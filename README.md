### Objectives

> - Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
> - Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform image visualization.
> - Perform image normalization and convert images from color-scaled to gray-scaled. 
> - Build a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a back-end.
> - Compile and fit Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to training data.
> - Assess the performance of trained Convolutional Neural Network model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
